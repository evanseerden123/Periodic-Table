        </div>
        <div className="p-6 prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>Group 2, the alkaline earth metals—beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra)—bridge the reactivity extremes of s-block elements. Their ns² valence electrons yield M²⁺ ions, and their name reflects alkaline oxides from mineral "earths." For scientists, their diagonal relationships (e.g., Be with Al) and ionic-covalent transitions offer insights into periodicity and thermodynamics.</p>
          
          <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties</h2>
          <p>Ionization energies decrease from Be (899 kJ/mol) to Ra (~509 kJ/mol), with atomic radii increasing (Be: 112 pm; Ba: 222 pm). Densities rise (Be: 1.85 g/cm³; Ra: ~5 g/cm³), and melting points vary (Be: 1287°C; Mg: 650°C). Beryllium’s small size and high charge density drive covalent character, forming polymeric BeX₂, unlike ionic CaX₂. Lattice energies are higher than Group 1 due to +2 charge, reducing solubility slightly.</p>
          
          <h2>Reactivity and Reactions</h2>
          <p>Less reactive than alkali metals, they react with water (Mg slowly; Ca vigorously: Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂) and acids, requiring heat for halogens. Their oxides (e.g., MgO, melting 2800°C) are refractory, used in high-temperature applications. Grignard reagents (RMgX) revolutionized organic synthesis by enabling carbon-carbon bond formation.</p>
          
          <h2>Applications and Biological Roles</h2>
          <p>Magnesium alloys (density 1.74 g/cm³) lighten aerospace components, calcium strengthens bones (99% skeletal), and barium sulfate aids X-ray imaging due to insolubility. Radium’s α-emission fueled early radiotherapy, now replaced by safer isotopes. Beryllium’s use in nuclear reflectors is tempered by berylliosis toxicity.</p>
          
          <h2>Future Directions</h2>
          <p>Calcium-based batteries offer sustainable alternatives to lithium, while strontium aluminate phosphors advance LED technology. Relativistic studies of radium isotopes inform heavy-element chemistry.</p>
