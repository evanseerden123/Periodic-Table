        </div>
        <div className="p-6 prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>The alkali metals, comprising Group 1 of the periodic table (excluding hydrogen), are lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). Named for their alkaline oxides derived from plant ashes (Arabic: "al-qaly"), these elements are pivotal in inorganic chemistry. Their extreme reactivity, driven by a single ns¹ valence electron, makes them essential for understanding s-block behavior, with applications in energy storage, spectroscopy, and nuclear science.</p>
          
          <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties</h2>
          <p>Alkali metals exhibit clear periodic trends: ionization energy decreases (Li: 520 kJ/mol; Cs: 376 kJ/mol), atomic radius increases (Li: 152 pm; Cs: 265 pm), and reactivity escalates down the group. Their low densities (Li: 0.534 g/cm³; Cs: 1.93 g/cm³) and softness (cesium is wax-like) reflect weak metallic bonding. Melting points drop from lithium (180.5°C) to cesium (28.5°C). The ns¹ electron facilitates M⁺ ion formation, yielding soluble ionic compounds due to low lattice energies from large cation sizes.</p>
          
          <h2>Reactivity and Reactions</h2>
          <p>Their hallmark reaction with water, 2M + 2H₂O → 2MOH + H₂, ranges from lithium’s gentle fizz to cesium’s explosive ignition, driven by increasingly negative standard electrode potentials (Li: -3.04 V; Cs: -3.026 V). They form oxides (Li₂O), peroxides (Na₂O₂), or superoxides (KO₂, CsO₂) with air, showcasing oxidation diversity. In organic chemistry, n-butyllithium drives nucleophilic additions and polymerizations, leveraging high polarity of M-C bonds.</p>
          
          <h2>Applications and Biological Roles</h2>
          <p>Sodium and potassium are vital in biology, powering Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase for membrane potentials. Industrially, lithium fuels high-capacity batteries ({">"}300 Wh/kg in Li-ion cells), sodium powers streetlights (high-pressure lamps), and cesium defines time (⁸⁷Cs hyperfine transition at 9.192 GHz). Francium’s short half-life (²²³Fr: 22 minutes) limits it to nuclear studies. Handling requires inert atmospheres to prevent corrosion.</p>
          
          <h2>Future Directions</h2>
          <p>Research explores lithium-free potassium batteries to address scarcity, solid-state electrolytes for safer energy storage, and quantum simulations of francium’s relativistic effects, pushing computational chemistry boundaries.</p>
