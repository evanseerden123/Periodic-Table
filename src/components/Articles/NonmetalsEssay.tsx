        <div className="p-6 prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>Nonmetals, located on the right side of the periodic table, include hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), astatine (At), and the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn). Characterized by high electronegativity and poor electrical conductivity, nonmetals are essential in organic chemistry, biology, and technology. For college students and scientists, their diverse bonding and reactivity patterns offer a rich field for studying chemical behavior and applications in materials science.</p>

          <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties</h2>
          <p>Nonmetals exhibit varied physical states: gases (O₂, N₂, F₂), liquids (Br₂), or solids (C, S, I₂) at room temperature. Electronegativity ranges from 2.55 (C) to 3.98 (F), driving covalent bonding or electron gain to form anions (e.g., O²⁻, Cl⁻). Ionization energies are high (e.g., N: 1402 kJ/mol; F: 1681 kJ/mol), and atomic radii are small (O: 66 pm; I: 140 pm). Nonmetals like carbon form allotropes (diamond, graphite, graphene), while sulfur’s multiple forms (rhombic, monoclinic) reflect structural diversity. Noble gases, with full ns² np⁶ shells, are nearly inert, with low boiling points (He: 4.2 K; Xe: 165 K).</p>

          <h2>Reactivity and Reactions</h2>
          <p>Reactivity varies widely. Halogens like fluorine react vigorously with most elements (e.g., F₂ + 2Na → 2NaF), forming ionic or covalent bonds. Oxygen drives oxidation (e.g., 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O), while nitrogen’s triple bond in N₂ (bond energy: 945 kJ/mol) renders it inert, requiring catalysts like in the Haber-Bosch process (N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃). Phosphorus forms flammable phosphines (PH₃), and sulfur yields strong acids (H₂SO₄). Noble gases, except xenon and krypton (e.g., XeF₂), rarely react due to high ionization energies.</p>

          <h2>Applications and Biological Roles</h2>
          <p>Nonmetals are foundational to life: carbon forms organic molecules, nitrogen and phosphorus underpin DNA/RNA, and oxygen sustains respiration. Industrially, chlorine disinfects water, fluorine enhances polymers (Teflon), and sulfur drives vulcanization. Selenium is used in photocells, and helium cools superconducting magnets (MRI). Iodine supports thyroid function, while astatine’s isotopes (e.g., ²¹¹At) are explored in radiotherapy. Noble gases like argon shield welding, and xenon is used in anesthesia.</p>

          <h2>Future Directions</h2>
          <p>Research focuses on nonmetal-based materials like graphene and phosphorene for electronics, fluorine-based electrolytes for batteries, and carbon capture technologies to combat climate change. Astatine’s nuclear properties drive advances in targeted alpha therapy, while noble gas clusters explore quantum computing applications.</p>
